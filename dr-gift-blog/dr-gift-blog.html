                    My favorite place to be is in the grass, in the sun, and in a warm or cool summer wind.
                    With these ingredients, I can make any place sacred. I am a thinker, writer, and a creative
                    who finds happiness and beauty in many things, in little things. Another sacred place for 
                    me is inside my head--as you can see. Hover for a closer look..

                                <p>&emsp;I was living in some type of “project,“ I think. But the apartment 
                                    I was in belonged to an Arab family. I was just kinda <em>there</em>; maybe I was <em>the help</em>. It 
                                    was on the top floor of a crooked building—no security, but no one would rob a place so poor. The 
                                    project had a tribal, pre-“our era” feel to it. Imagine a big project building surrounded by an
                                    indigenous village and its people. Misplaced is the word. The entrance to the
                                    building was a long, crude tunnel made of sticks with dirty, tannish brown fabric covering.
                                    The fabric was torn, of course, and the sun shone through. This tunnel, though, was deserted, 
                                    as if no one ever came there, as if no one ever left.
                                    <br><br>
                                    &emsp;Suddenly, I was in a place that I frequented, structured like a school or church. 
                                    I was a student, but not like continuing education. I was a student in a children’s school 
                                    setting, and I was an adult—as I look today. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    &emsp;Something made me angry, and I don’t remember what. The man in catholic priest garb was 
                                    taking collection, and I was furious at him. I was protesting and screaming something at him, but 
                                    he just laughed and walked away. Everyone else oblivious.
                                    <br><br>
                                    So, I stole the bulk of the collection money and left like I would normally, on foot.
                                    <br><br>
                                    &emsp;I was back home, and the Arab family was moving to Calhoun street. The landlord is allowing 
                                    me to take over the lease. I stood there after they left, and the house was completely empty. No  
                                    furniture—nothing. The sun was bright. Everything was tan. I’m leaving. I'm going to leave. As I descended,  
                                    I passed back through the school church place. Everyone was frantic about the lost money. Catholic Man was 
                                    furious and searching everyone. He suspected me. At once, a mass of tribal children from the village 
                                    came to hide me from Catholic Man. Instantly, I was in my van in the midst of the frantic people, but it 
                                    was so noisy, and I was struggling to keep the lights off or the music low or something. Whatever it was, 
                                    the van drew attention to me. He saw me. He wanted to search me.
                                    <br><br>
                                    &emsp;I had the money hidden in my bra, and I watched myself put up such an argument to evade him.
                                    Then, I was on foot again, and I ran. Having reached the tunnel connected to the entrance of the building, I 
                                    stopped. Everything stopped. There was no paved ground, but brown, cool Earth under my feet. It was quiet 
                                    there and windy. It was calm and peaceful. It felt like home and freedom. I belong here. No one from the 
                                    building would find me here. Ever.
                                    <br><br>
                                    &emsp;Then the children were there. They were dirty and barefoot, dressed in the same tattered fabric 
                                    of the tunnel. Their fabric was dark green, however, like the forest. Perhaps I was, too, dressed exactly 
                                    as they were. They led me to the spaceship that frequented the area. It always sealed itself shut when 
                                    transporting the children.  I was big on the ship, but I was on it. It sealed itself around me as well
                                    as I fell asleep. The drift was one of those intoxicating, warm, care-free drifts as I passed into
                                    oblivion. I left everything behind, and I knew that I was safe and that everything was going to be
                                    alright. This was surrender. I was happily at the beginning of my journey to freedom.

                                How I love India's culture and it's people, rich in beauty and spirituality. I
                                promise to visit, for there is much I want to learn. There is much I want to unlearn.
                                So, today, on my mind is this:<br><br>
                                <span id="chant">Om Asatoma Sadgamaya</span><br><br>
                                <u>Translation:</u><br><br>
                                "Keep me not in the phenomenal world of Unreality.
                                Make me go towards the Reality of the Eternal Self.
                                Keep me not in the world of mortality.
                                Make me go towards the world of immortality...of self-realization."
