            <p id="bio">
                &emsp;<span id="first-letter">H</span>e called me Shanti, and that, I was so named. Perhaps I bring him peace,
                or maybe it serves as a nickname for my birth name, Chantelle. Either way, I accepted and was grateful for it.
                <br>
                &emsp;Shanti is the Sanskrit word for peace, and it suits me well, for it's a word that closely desbribes my
                ongoing emotional state, aura, and personality. At least, that is what I strive for. Every personal thing that
                I do is a quest for peace, freedom, and creative expression.
                <br>
                &emsp;I believe in the sacredness of names, and it means a great deal to me that someone took note of me,
                beyond me, and called me Shanti. Others have called me Imani Shante, Baccha, and Amira. I find it quite interesting
                and fortunate that my given name, <em>Chantelle Marie du Jardin</em>, becomes me completely--each name, each 
                meaning. However, I call myself <em>Chantelle Willow Spirit</em>, so named after the grand willow tree and the upper
                air, the aether.
                <br>
                &emsp;I stand grounded to the Earth in love and harmony. Yet, my thoughts and my voice travel in the wind. In this
                way, I am ever changing--ever growing. Mutable me. I am one who can travel to distant worlds, in and out of time. I
                am an ear, a voice of wisdom, a care-giver, and nurturer to those fated to visit. For this, I am grateful, and the
                thought alone has brought me peace.
                <br>
                &emsp;Childhood presented me with many fears and challenges to overcome, and that drew me into myself, into
                thought, into imagination, and into books. I was drawn to poetry and story-telling.
                <br>
                &emsp;Notice the video I chose for the background of this page. Can you imagine the serenity experienced by the 
                stones? The moss? Feel the stillness, the rest, the calm, and take a deep breath..
                <br>
                &emsp;I can smell damp soil, cool and comforting to the touch, beneath my bare feet. There's a river nearby and a
                chill in the air that reveals the warmth on my breath. The sun is here, high and bright, peaking through the trees.
                I find a place in the sunlight, for there is something magical and mystical about standing in a light between two
                shadows. With eyes closed and breath deep, I silently rejoice in the mixture of hot sun and cool air. I take note
                of my quickened heartbeat, slowed mind, and the electric charge beneath me. I stand here in mountain pose, alert and
                strong, grounded to the Earth, surrounded by love, enveloped in <em>Nature's Quiet</em>, the pure and natural symphony
                of frequencies that frees souls.
                <br>
                &emsp;This is why I am here in the wildnerness all alone--to learn to be free and at peace with myself and others.
                I do love people, and I can, it seems, only connect with them through the power of words. Words, faithful and true,
                are my superpower, and I share with you now a poem close to my heart, one that will indeed be published on The
                <em>Wow</em> Journal. Yes, I can, and often do, break my own rules. Do enjoy.
                <br><br>
                <blockquote id="my-poem">
                    <h5>The Cursed Not, Poetic Heart</h5>
                    He said he was "cursed with poetry at a young age," like me, and so developed "unrealistic expectations" of love 
                    and romance. But he is alive, and the words that molded his mind--our minds--were written by the flesh and heart, 
                    like mine. And so I was called to poetry. I am able to love like them, like him. It cannot be unrealistic. What a 
                    terrible grave to dig for the intensity in which we love, we poets. Are we, all of us, doomed to wander alone in 
                    the isolation of time periods and memories past? To live breathing in the air of mystery, never having fully loved 
                    or been loved? To carry a heart ever ablaze that intensifies the fire of the soul? Oh, separation is death. Our fire 
                    is too much to bear alone, and so we are consumed by it--detaching from all, suffering fleeting infatuations throughout 
                    the ages.
